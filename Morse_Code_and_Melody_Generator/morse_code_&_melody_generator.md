#Morse Code & Melody Generator

In this project, the Arduino generates a morse code in the form of blinking an LED as per the corresponding morse signal and the buzzing of a piezo buzzer. Also on switching to melody-mode (via the serial monitor), the piezo buzzer plays whatever note is input via the computer keyboard.
