#LED Controller
Hardware:

* Arduino Uno 
* 3 LEDs
* 2 Switches

***

Using two switches, a total of four possible patterns of LEDs can be controlled (ON-ON, OFF-ON, ON-OFF, OFF-OFF). In this project these correspond to:

1. Flashing Forward (ON-OFF-OFF, OFF-ON-OFF, OFF-OFF-ON)
2. Flashing Backward (OFF-OFF-ON, OFF-ON-OFF, ON-OFF-OFF)
3. All Flashing (ON-ON-ON, OFF-OFF-OFF)
4. Keep current LED status.
